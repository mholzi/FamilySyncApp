# Security Notes for FamilySync Web App

## Dependency Vulnerabilities Status

As of 2025-01-08:

### Resolved Vulnerabilities
- **nth-check** ReDoS vulnerability - Fixed via npm overrides
- **postcss** parsing vulnerability - Fixed via npm overrides

### Remaining Vulnerabilities
- **webpack-dev-server** (2 moderate) - These only affect the development environment and are not present in production builds. They are dependencies of `react-scripts@5.0.1` and cannot be fixed without ejecting from Create React App.

### Mitigation
- Production builds are not affected by webpack-dev-server vulnerabilities
- Consider migrating to Vite or Next.js in the future to avoid Create React App limitations
- Regular security audits should be performed

## Environment Variables
- Firebase configuration has been moved to environment variables
- `.env.local` file contains sensitive data and is properly gitignored
- `.env.example` provided for documentation
