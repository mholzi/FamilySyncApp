# Dashboard Improvements Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. 🗑️ Removed Redundant "My Tasks Today" Section for Parents

**Problem:** The "My Tasks Today" section was showing for both parents and au pairs, but parents now have the "Household Tasks for Au Pair" section which serves the same purpose.

**Solution:** 
- Wrapped the "My Tasks Today" section in a conditional: `{userRole === 'aupair' && ...}`
- Now only au pairs see "My Tasks Today"
- Parents only see "Household Tasks for Au Pair"

**Code Changes:**
```jsx
{/* My Tasks Today - Only show for Au Pairs */}
{userRole === 'aupair' && (
  <section style={styles.section}>
    // ... My Tasks Today content
  </section>
)}
```

### 2. 🎯 Improved Empty State Messages

**Problem:** The loading spinner and empty state messages weren't specific enough for the dashboard context.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced empty state messages to be role-specific
- Parents see: "No household tasks created yet. Click 'Add Task +' above to create the first task for your au pair."
- Au pairs see: "No tasks assigned to you yet."
- Better guidance for first-time users

**Code Changes:**
```jsx
userRole === 'parent' 
  ? 'No household tasks created yet. Click "Add Task +" above to create the first task for your au pair.'
  : 'No tasks assigned to you yet.'
```
