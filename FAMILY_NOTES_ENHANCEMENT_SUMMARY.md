# Family Notes Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fix Priority Level Access (HIGH)
**File**: `web-app/src/components/Notes/AddFamilyNote.js`
- Removed role-based restrictions on priority level selection
- All users (parents and au pairs) can now set any priority level
- Priority serves only as visual indicator for importance

### 2. ✅ Add Character Counter (HIGH)
**File**: `web-app/src/components/Notes/AddFamilyNote.js`
- Added character counter below textarea showing "X/500"
- Color changes based on character count:
  - Gray: < 400 characters
  - Orange: 400-450 characters  
  - Red: > 450 characters
- Prevents typing beyond 500 characters
- Works in both create and edit modes

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Integration (MEDIUM)
**File**: `web-app/src/components/Notes/FamilyNotesList.js`
- Enhanced existing component to sort notes by priority then timestamp
- Shows top 3 most important undismissed notes on dashboard
- Sorting order: urgent → important → normal
- Already integrated in Dashboard component

### 4. ✅ Auto-refresh Timestamps (MEDIUM)
**File**: `web-app/src/components/Notes/FamilyNoteCard.js`
- Implemented automatic timestamp refresh every 60 seconds
- Uses React.memo to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Timestamps update from "Just now" → "1m ago" → "2m ago" etc. automatically

### 5. ✅ Fix Mobile Scrolling (LOW)
**File**: `web-app/src/components/Notes/FamilyNotesModal.js`
