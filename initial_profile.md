# Profile Button & Menu - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE
<!-- 
Comprehensive profile button and dropdown menu system for the FamilySync application header.
The profile button serves as the main user access point for profile management, settings, and navigation.
Must differentiate between Parent and Au Pair user types with appropriate menu options and functionality.
-->

### User Story
As a **Parent** or **Au Pair**, I want to access my profile information, settings, and user management options through a profile button in the header so that I can manage my account and family interactions efficiently.

### Detailed Requirements

#### Profile Button (Top-Right Header)
1. **Visual Design**
   - 36px circular profile button with user's profile picture or initials
   - Blue accent color (#007AFF) for initial placeholder
   - Subtle drop shadow and hover effects
   - Active state with slight scale and glow effect

2. **Profile Picture Display**
   - Display user's uploaded profile picture if available
   - Fallback to user initials (first letter of first/last name) if no picture
   - Circular crop for profile images
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

3. **Interaction States**
   - Default: Subtle shadow, blue background for initials
   - Hover: Darker blue (#0056D6), slight scale (1.05x)
   - Active/Open: Maintained scale with blue glow ring
   - Focus: Blue outline for keyboard navigation

#### Profile Dropdown Menu
4. **Menu Structure & Animation**
   - Dropdown appears below profile button with smooth slide-down animation
   - White background with rounded corners (12px radius)

   - Larger profile picture/initials (40px)
   - User's full name in bold

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
<!-- 
Capture all edge cases, gotchas, and special requirements.
This is critical for preventing common mistakes.
-->

### Known Gotchas
- Firestore limitation: User profile updates may require cache invalidation
- React pattern: Avoid inline arrow functions in render for performance
- Performance consideration: Lazy load profile picture uploads
- Menu positioning: Ensure dropdown doesn't overflow viewport boundaries

### Security Requirements
- [ ] User must be authenticated to access profile features
- [ ] User can only edit their own profile information
- [ ] Input validation required for profile updates
- [ ] Rate limiting needed for profile picture uploads
- [ ] Role-based menu item visibility enforcement

### Performance Requirements
- Profile button render time: < 100ms
- Dropdown menu animation: < 200ms
- Profile picture loading: < 2 seconds
- Support concurrent profile updates gracefully

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for ProfileIcon component interactions
- [ ] Unit tests for ProfileMenu component rendering
- [ ] Integration tests for profile data updates
- [ ] E2E test for complete profile management flow
- [ ] Manual testing for different user roles

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast ratios
- [ ] Focus management for dropdown menu
- [ ] Alt text for profile pictures

### Internationalization
- [ ] All menu item labels use i18n keys
- [ ] Support for English and German languages
- [ ] Right-to-left language support consideration
- [ ] Localized role names ("Host Parent" vs "Gastfamilie")

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for:
  - Profile picture upload failures
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Invalid profile data
  - Authentication session expiry
  - Permission denied errors

### Edge Cases
1. What happens when user has no profile picture and no name?
2. What if user role is undefined or invalid?
3. How to handle profile updates while menu is open?
4. What if Firebase user data is inconsistent?
5. How to handle profile picture upload size limits?

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed: None (using existing Firebase and React)
- Firebase services required: Auth, Firestore, Storage (for profile pictures)
- Environment variables: Firebase configuration

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: Profile menu can be disabled via environment variable
- Data migration reversible: Profile updates are non-destructive
- Backward compatibility maintained: Yes, existing auth flow unchanged

## NOTES
<!-- 
Any additional context, decisions made, or open questions.

### Family Management Implementation Details

#### Invitation System Architecture
1. **Data Structure**
   - Store invitations in `families` collection with status fields
   - Each invitation has unique random alphanumeric code
   - Track invitation status: pending, viewed, accepted, expired
   - Parent invitations pre-set role as "Parent" with full permissions

2. **Parent Invitation Flow**
   - Enter only email address for invited parent
   - System generates unique invitation code per email
   - Email contains family name, inviting parent name, and signup link
   - Special messaging identifies this as parent/co-parent invitation
   - Both parents have equal permissions automatically

3. **Au Pair Invitation Flow**
   - Enter only au pair email address
   - Unique code generated for each invitation
   - Parents can view/cancel pending invitations
   - No permission management (removed from scope)

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - **Parent View**: Family Management shows sections:
     - Current Family Members (parents and au pairs)
     - Children (using existing child cards, editable)
     - Pending Invitations (with status tracking)
   - **Au Pair View**: 
     - Invitation card with family preview (size, children ages, location)
     - Countdown to start date after acceptance
     - Welcome message with quick links on arrival date (dismissible)

5. **Family Member Management**
   - Reuse children overview cards from main dashboard
   - Allow editing of child profiles (name, birthdate, etc.)
   - Add/remove family members functionality
   - Grid layout within sectioned view

### Open Questions
1. Should expired invitations be automatically deleted or archived?
2. What should the invitation email template look like?
3. Should we log invitation history for audit purposes?
4. How long should invitation codes remain valid?

### Assumptions
1. Users will have either Parent or Au Pair role (no admin role initially)
2. Profile pictures will be stored in Firebase Storage
3. User preferences will be stored in Firestore user document
4. All parents have equal permissions (no primary/secondary parent roles)
5. Email sending will use Firebase Cloud Functions
6. Invitation codes are single-use only

### Out of Scope
1. Permission management for au pairs (all have same access level)
2. Bulk invitation sending
3. Invitation templates or customization
4. Au pair rating or review system
5. Historical au pair tracking
6. Integration with external au pair agencies
