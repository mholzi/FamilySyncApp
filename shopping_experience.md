## Mock Data & Implementation Issues

### üîç Areas Still Using Mock Data

2. **Supermarket Logos**: `familySupermarketsUtils.js` - Using emoji/simple icons, could benefit from real logos
3. **Photo Upload**: `shoppingPhotoUpload.js` - Functional but could use optimization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Items That Need Fixing

1. **Image Compression**: Receipt photos are uploaded without compression

## Conclusion

The FamilySync shopping experience has a solid foundation with core functionality implemented for both parents and au pairs. The receipt upload and payment tracking system is particularly well-designed. However, there are significant opportunities for improvement in user experience, collaboration features, and smart functionality.

The most critical gaps are around shopping list templates, quantity management, budget tracking, and offline support. Addressing these would significantly improve the daily shopping experience for families.

The technical implementation is sound but would benefit from offline support, better error handling, and performance optimizations for larger families with extensive shopping histories.
