# Au Pair Empowerment & Appreciation System - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE
<!-- 
Provide a comprehensive description of what needs to be built.
Be specific about functionality, user interactions, and expected outcomes.
Include acceptance criteria if applicable.
-->

### User Story
As an au pair, I want to see my achievements and receive appreciation from parents so that I feel motivated, valued, and confident in my performance.

### Detailed Requirements
1. **Appreciation Tracking System**
   - Parents can give positive feedback/appreciation for multiple categories:
     * Task completion and quality
     * General behavior and attitude ("Sarah was so patient with the kids today")
     * Proactive actions ("Thanks for organizing the playroom without being asked")
     * Crisis handling ("Great job managing the tantrum at the store")
     * Learning and improvement ("Your German is getting so much better!")
     * Daily interactions and family integration
   - Appreciation is visible in a dedicated section of the au pair's profile
   - System tracks and displays appreciation history with timestamps and categories
   - Au pair receives real-time notifications when appreciation is given
   - Parents can add appreciation through multiple entry points (task completion, general appreciation button, etc.)

2. **Achievement Recognition Dashboard**
   - Daily streak tracking with prominent display ("5 days in a row! ðŸ”¥")
   - Monthly/weekly completion statistics display ("You've completed 95% of tasks this month!")
   - Progress tracking for different task categories (cleaning, childcare, shopping, etc.)
   - Achievement badges for milestones (first week, 50 tasks completed, perfect week, etc.)
   - Visual progress indicators showing improvement over time
   - Streak celebration animations when reaching milestones (3, 7, 14, 30 days)

3. **Smart Parent Appreciation Triggers**
   - Automatic prompts for parents when au pair reaches streak milestones (3, 7, 14+ days)
   - Suggested appreciation messages: "Sarah has completed tasks 7 days in a row! Send her some encouragement?"
   - One-tap appreciation sending with pre-written templates
   - Customizable streak thresholds per family (some families may want daily, others weekly prompts)

4. **Motivational Feedback System**
   - Real-time positive reinforcement for task completion
   - Celebration animations/visual feedback for achievements
   - Family connection metrics (messages responded to, family activities participated in)
   - Personal growth tracking (response time improvements, task quality scores)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Au pair can view appreciation messages from parents in a dedicated section
- [ ] Achievement statistics are calculated and displayed accurately
- [ ] Positive feedback increases au pair app engagement by 25%
- [ ] Parents report improved communication and appreciation workflow
- [ ] Achievement badges motivate continued high performance

## EXAMPLES
<!-- 
Reference existing code patterns that should be followed.
Point to specific files in the examples/ directory.
Include both positive examples (to follow) and negative examples (to avoid).
-->

### Patterns to Follow
- Component structure: See existing profile components in `web-app/src/components/Profile/`
- Firebase operations: See task completion tracking in `web-app/src/utils/familyUtils.js`
- Real-time updates: See notification system in `web-app/src/hooks/useNotifications.js`
- Dashboard design: See existing dashboard layout in `web-app/src/components/Dashboard.js`

### Similar Features in Codebase

- Similar component: `web-app/src/components/Dashboard.js` (for achievement cards)
- Profile components: `web-app/src/components/Profile/ProfilePage.js`

- Security requirements: See CLAUDE.md section "Security Rules"
- UI Guidelines: See CLAUDE.md section "UI Design Guidelines"
- Firebase patterns: See CLAUDE.md section "Firebase Gotchas & Library Quirks"

### Relevant PRDs/Specs
- User empowerment requirements from initial au pair feedback analysis
- Family communication enhancement specifications

---

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
<!-- 
Capture all edge cases, gotchas, and special requirements.
This is critical for preventing common mistakes.
-->

### Known Gotchas
- Firestore limitation: Real-time listeners count against read quotas - optimize listener usage
- React pattern: Avoid state updates during render cycles when calculating achievements
- Performance consideration: Cache achievement calculations to avoid recalculating on every render

### Security Requirements
- [ ] User must be authenticated to view their own achievements
- [ ] Au pair can only view their own appreciation and achievements
- [ ] Parents can only give appreciation to their family's au pair
- [ ] Input validation required for appreciation messages
- [ ] Rate limiting needed for appreciation submissions to prevent spam

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: < 2 seconds for achievements dashboard
- Real-time sync latency: < 500ms for new appreciation notifications
- Support concurrent users: Handle multiple parents giving appreciation simultaneously

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for achievement calculation logic
- [ ] Integration tests for Firebase appreciation operations
- [ ] E2E test for parent giving appreciation to au pair
- [ ] Manual testing checklist for achievement badge triggers

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for achievement dashboard
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility for appreciation messages
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all new components
- [ ] Color contrast ratios met for achievement badges

### Internationalization
- [ ] All user-facing text uses i18n keys
- [ ] Support for English and German achievement messages
- [ ] Date/time formatting respects locale for appreciation timestamps
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity in achievement messaging

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for:
  - Network failures when loading achievements
  - Permission denied when accessing other family's data
  - Invalid input in appreciation messages
  - Server errors during achievement calculation

### Edge Cases
1. What happens when user is offline and receives appreciation?
2. What if Firebase quota is exceeded during achievement calculations?
3. How to handle achievement calculation when task history is incomplete?
4. What if family member leaves and appreciation history needs to be preserved?

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed: None (using existing React and Firebase setup)
- Firebase services required: Firestore for appreciation storage, Cloud Functions for achievement calculations
- Environment variables: None additional required

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: Enable/disable achievement system via environment variable
- Data migration reversible: Yes - appreciation data can be archived without deletion
- Backward compatibility maintained: Yes - existing task and profile systems remain unchanged

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
<!-- 
Define how to verify the feature is working correctly.
Include both automated and manual validation steps.
-->

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Run these commands to validate implementation
cd web-app
npm run lint
npm test -- --coverage
npm run build

cd ../functions
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

### Manual Validation
- [ ] Au pair can view appreciation messages from parents
- [ ] Achievement statistics calculate correctly for different time periods
- [ ] Achievement badges appear when milestones are reached
- [ ] Parents can successfully give appreciation through the interface
- [ ] Real-time updates work for new appreciation
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified

### Integration Points
- [ ] Authentication flow integrated for role-based access
- [ ] Real-time sync working for appreciation notifications
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading states implemented for achievement calculations
- [ ] Empty states designed for new au pairs with no achievements

---

## NOTES
<!-- 
Any additional context, decisions made, or open questions.
-->

### Open Questions
1. Should achievements be gamified with points/levels or keep it simple with percentage-based metrics?
2. How long should appreciation messages be stored (indefinitely or with retention policy)?

### Assumptions
1. Parents want to give appreciation but need an easy, structured way to do so
2. Au pairs are motivated by positive feedback and achievement recognition
3. Family relationships improve when appreciation is visible and trackable

### Out of Scope
1. Comparison between different au pairs (privacy concerns)
2. Advanced analytics for family management insights
3. Integration with external motivation/reward systems
4. Automated appreciation based on task completion (should remain human-driven)
