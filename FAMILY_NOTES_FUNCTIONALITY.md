# Family Notes Functionality - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE

The Family Notes functionality is a comprehensive family communication system that enables parents and au pairs to share important information, updates, and reminders through a centralized note-taking interface. It serves as the primary communication hub for day-to-day family coordination, with visual priority indicators for message importance, role-based editing permissions, and intelligent cleanup mechanisms.

### User Story
As a family member (parent or au pair), I want to create, share, and manage family notes so that I can communicate important information about children, schedules, rules, and general family matters. I want to set priority levels to visually highlight the importance of messages, making critical information stand out in the dashboard view for all family members.

### Detailed Requirements

#### Core Note Management
1. **Note Creation and Editing**
   - Rich text content with 500 character limit
   - Priority levels for visual importance: `normal`, `urgent`, `important`
   - Category classification: `general`, `kids`, `schedule`, `rules`
   - Real-time Firestore synchronization
   - Edit history tracking with "(edited)" indicators

2. **Note Display and Filtering**
   - Chronological display with newest notes first
   - Filter by category and priority level
   - Visual priority indicators with color coding (urgent: red, important: orange, normal: gray)
   - Priority-based sorting in dashboard view for visual prominence
   - Author name display with fallback to role names
   - Timestamp display with relative time formatting

3. **Note Dismissal System**
   - Individual user dismissal capability
   - Automatic cleanup when all family members dismiss
   - Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
   - Persistent dismissal state across sessions

#### Role-Based Functionality
4. **Parent Capabilities**
   - Create notes with any priority level (normal, urgent, important)
   - Edit and delete any family note
   - Access to all note management features
   - Quick templates for common parent communications

5. **Au Pair Capabilities**
   - Create notes with any priority level (normal, urgent, important)
   - Edit and delete own notes only
   - Dismissal rights for all notes
   - Specialized templates for au pair communications

#### Advanced Features
6. **Template System**
   - Role-specific quick templates for common messages
   - Parent templates: permissions, schedule changes, special rules
   - Au pair templates: daily reports, questions, schedule updates
   - One-click template application with category auto-selection

7. **Real-time Synchronization**
   - Firestore onSnapshot listeners for instant updates
   - Automatic re-rendering when notes change
   - Network error handling with graceful degradation
   - Offline capability with sync on reconnection

8. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Modal-based interface for focused interaction
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Empty state management with helpful prompts
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

### Known Gotchas
- Firebase limitation: Real-time listeners must be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- React pattern: Optimistic updates must be reverted on Firebase errors
- Performance consideration: Large families with many notes need efficient filtering
- Security consideration: Note content must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Mobile consideration: Modal interfaces need proper touch handling

### Security Requirements
- [x] User must be authenticated to access family notes
- [x] User can only access their family's notes (family-scoped queries)
- [x] Input validation required for: note content, priority levels, categories
- [x] Role-based restrictions enforced for editing and deletion only
- [x] Content sanitization implemented to prevent XSS attacks

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: < 1 second for notes modal opening
- Real-time sync latency: < 300ms for note updates
- Support concurrent users: Multiple family members creating/editing simultaneously
- Note limit: Efficient handling of 100+ notes per family
- Memory efficiency: Proper cleanup of dismissed notes

### Testing Requirements
- [x] Unit tests for note creation, editing, and deletion
- [x] Integration tests for Firestore real-time updates
- [ ] E2E test for role-based permission enforcement
- [ ] Manual testing checklist for template system
- [ ] Performance testing with large note datasets

### Accessibility Requirements
- [x] Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility for note cards
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast
- [x] Color contrast ratios met for priority indicators
- [x] Focus management in modal interfaces

### Internationalization
- [ ] All user-facing text uses i18n keys
- [x] Support for English and German UI
- [x] Date/time formatting respects locale
- [ ] Template text localized for different languages

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for:
  - Network failures during Firestore sync
  - Permission denied for note modifications
  - Invalid note content or length limits
  - Missing family or user data
  - Firestore quota exceeded errors

### Edge Cases
1. **Concurrent Editing**: Multiple users editing same note simultaneously (Currently last-write-wins)
2. **Dismissed Note Revival**: What happens when dismissed note is edited? (Currently reappears)
3. **Family Member Removal**: How to handle notes from removed family members? (Cleanup utility exists)
4. **Large Note Content**: How to handle very long notes? (500 character limit enforced)
5. **Priority Display**: How are notes sorted when multiple have same priority? (Chronological within priority level)
6. **Empty Family**: What shows when no family members exist? (Error handling in place)
7. **Offline Mode**: How to handle note creation while offline? (Currently not supported)

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed: None (uses existing Firebase SDK)
- Firebase services required: Firestore for real-time data sync
- Environment variables: Firebase configuration
- User authentication: Requires authenticated user session
- Family membership: User must be part of family to access notes

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: Not currently implemented (would need feature toggle)
- Data migration reversible: Yes (notes are independent documents)
- Backward compatibility maintained: Yes (graceful degradation for missing data)

## NOTES

### Open Questions
1. Should there be a character limit notification as users type?
2. How should we handle push notifications for urgent notes?
3. Should we add rich text formatting (bold, italics, etc.)?
4. Do we need search functionality for large note collections?
5. Should there be note archiving instead of deletion?

### Assumptions
1. Families will use notes for daily communication (5-10 notes per day)
2. Most notes will be dismissed within 24-48 hours
3. Role-based permissions are sufficient for family dynamics
4. 500 character limit is adequate for most communications
5. Real-time updates are essential for family coordination

### Out of Scope
1. Rich text formatting (bold, italics, links, etc.)
2. File attachments or photo sharing in notes
3. Push notifications for new or urgent notes
4. Note search and advanced filtering
5. Note archiving and historical access
6. Integration with external calendar systems
7. Bulk note operations (select multiple, batch delete)
8. Note templates customization by families
9. Analytics on note usage patterns
10. Email notifications for offline family members

### Current Implementation Status
- [x] Core note creation and display functionality
