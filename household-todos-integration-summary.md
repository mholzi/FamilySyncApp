### 🎯 Database Structure
```

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### File Structure
```
web-app/src/
├── components/HouseholdTodos/
│   ├── TodoCard.js & .css
│   ├── TodoList.js & .css
│   ├── AddTodo.js & .css
│   └── index.js

│   └── householdTodosUtils.js
└── components/Dashboard.js (updated)
```

### Security Considerations
- Current Firestore rules are permissive (expires Aug 2, 2025)
- Production rules should restrict access to family-scoped data
- User role validation should be implemented at the database level

### Performance Optimizations
- Real-time listeners only fetch today's tasks by default
- Efficient querying with compound indexes
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The household todos feature is fully integrated and ready for use. Parents can immediately start creating tasks for their au pairs, and au pairs can begin completing assigned chores. The feature follows the established FamilySync design patterns and maintains consistency with the existing user experience.
