## MATERIAL DESIGN 3 PRINCIPLES

### Core Design Principles

1. **Material is the Metaphor**
   - Interface elements should resemble physical materials
   - Use elevation and shadows to create depth
   - Components should feel tactile and responsive

2. **Bold, Graphic, Intentional**
   - Use bold colors and typography for clear visual hierarchy
   - Make intentional design decisions that guide user attention
   - Create clear focal points with color and space

3. **Motion Provides Meaning**
   - Animations should guide understanding and provide feedback
   - Use consistent easing curves and durations
   - Motion should feel natural and purposeful

4. **Adaptive and Personal**
   - Support dynamic theming from user preferences
   - Ensure design works across all device sizes
   - Allow for personalization while maintaining usability

### Key MD3 Foundations

1. **Dynamic Color System**
   - **HCT Color Space**: Hue (0-360Â°), Chroma (purity), Tone (lightness)
   - **Color Roles**: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Surface, Error
   - **Schemes**: Support for both dynamic and static color schemes
   - **Theme Generation**: Create accessible palettes from source colors

2. **Typography Scale**
   ```
   Display Large: 57sp
   Display Medium: 45sp
   Display Small: 36sp
   Headline Large: 32sp
   Headline Medium: 28sp
   Headline Small: 24sp
   Title Large: 22sp
   Title Medium: 16sp (medium weight)
   Title Small: 14sp (medium weight)
   Body Large: 16sp
   Body Medium: 14sp
   Body Small: 12sp
   Label Large: 14sp (medium weight)
   Label Medium: 12sp (medium weight)
   Label Small: 11sp (medium weight)
   ```

3. **Shape System**
   - Extra Small: 4dp corners
   - Small: 8dp corners
   - Medium: 12dp corners
   - Large: 16dp corners
   - Extra Large: 28dp corners

4. **Elevation Levels**
   - Level 0: 0dp (surface)
   - Level 1: 1dp (low elevation)
   - Level 2: 3dp (medium elevation)
   - Level 3: 6dp (high elevation)
   - Level 4: 8dp (highest container elevation)
   - Level 5: 12dp (highest elevation)

5. **State Layers**
   - Hover: 8% opacity
   - Focus: 12% opacity
   - Pressed: 12% opacity
   - Dragged: 16% opacity

## EXAMPLES

### Patterns to Follow
- Component structure: Implement MD3 components using Web Components or React wrappers
- Color implementation: Use CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Typography: Define reusable text styles matching MD3 scale
- Motion: Use CSS transitions with MD3 easing functions

### MD3 Component Examples

1. **Button Component**
   ```jsx
   // MD3 Filled Button
   <Button 
     variant="filled"
     onClick={handleClick}
     className="md3-button--filled"
   >
     <span className="md3-button__label">Click me</span>
     <span className="md3-button__state-layer"></span>
   </Button>
   ```

2. **Card Component**
   ```jsx
   // MD3 Elevated Card
   <Card className="md3-card--elevated" elevation={1}>
     <CardContent>
       <Typography variant="headlineSmall">Card Title</Typography>
       <Typography variant="bodyMedium">Card content goes here</Typography>
     </CardContent>
   </Card>
   ```

3. **Color Token Usage**
   ```css
   /* MD3 Color Tokens */
   .component {
     background-color: var(--md-sys-color-surface);
     color: var(--md-sys-color-on-surface);
   }
   
   .primary-button {
     background-color: var(--md-sys-color-primary);
     color: var(--md-sys-color-on-primary);
   }
   ```

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

### Known Gotchas

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - CSS custom properties required for dynamic theming
   - Web Components may need polyfills for older browsers
   - Container queries helpful but not required

2. **React Integration**
   - Material Web components require React wrappers
   - MUI v5 doesn't fully support MD3 yet
   - Consider using material-web-components-react package

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Dynamic color calculation can be CPU intensive
   - Limit color scheme changes to avoid repaints
   - Use CSS containment for complex components

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Sanitize any user-provided colors for theme generation
- [ ] Ensure contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Validate theme preferences before applying
- [ ] Protect against CSS injection in dynamic styles

### Performance Requirements
- Initial theme generation: < 100ms
- Theme switching: < 50ms
- Component render: < 16ms (60fps)
- Support smooth animations on mid-range devices

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Visual regression tests for all components
- [ ] Color contrast automated testing
- [ ] Theme switching integration tests
- [ ] Accessibility automated scans
- [ ] Cross-browser visual consistency
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle tests

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all color combinations
- [ ] Focus indicators visible in all themes
- [ ] Reduced motion option respects user preferences
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 48x48dp
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all features

### Internationalization
- [ ] RTL layout support for typography
- [ ] Culturally appropriate color meanings
- [ ] Font support for German characters
- [ ] Proper spacing for translated text

### Error Handling
- Fallback to default theme if dynamic generation fails
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Clear error messages for theme loading issues
- Maintain usability even without JavaScript

### Edge Cases
1. What if user's wallpaper produces inaccessible colors?
   â Force minimum contrast ratios
2. How to handle users who prefer reduced motion?
   â Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
3. What if Material Web CDN is unavailable?
   â Self-host critical components
4. How to support IE11 users?
   â Provide basic fallback styles

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed:
  - `@material/web` or `material-web-components-react`
  - CSS custom properties ponyfill (for older browsers)
- Firebase services required: None additional
- Environment variables: 
  - `REACT_APP_THEME_MODE` (dynamic|static)
  - `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_THEME` (light|dark)

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Set up MD3 color system and typography
2. **Phase 2**: Update core components (buttons, cards, inputs)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement motion and state layers
4. **Phase 4**: Add dynamic theming support
5. **Phase 5**: Complete accessibility enhancements

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_MD3_UI`
- Keep existing styles in separate legacy file

## NOTES

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Foundation**: Implement color tokens and typography first
2. **Component Library Choice**: Recommend material-web-components-react for full MD3 compliance
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Keep existing UI functional during migration
4. **Theme Persistence**: Store user theme preferences in Firebase user profile

### Key Differences from Current UI
1. More rounded corners (current uses subtle shadows)
2. Dynamic color from user preferences (current uses fixed palette)
3. Larger touch targets for better mobile UX
4. Enhanced state feedback with ripples and overlays
5. Refined typography scale with better hierarchy

### Resources for AI Implementation
- Use Material Theme Builder to generate initial color schemes
- Reference official MD3 component demos for implementation patterns
- Follow Material Web example implementations
- Use Figma Material 3 kit for design verification

### Open Questions
1. Should we support wallpaper-based dynamic theming on web?
2. Which component library provides best React integration?
3. How to handle gradual migration without breaking existing features?

### Assumptions
1. Users want a modern, personalized interface
2. Performance budget allows for theme calculations
3. Target browsers support modern CSS features
4. Team has capacity for comprehensive UI update

### Out of Scope
1. Native mobile app implementations
2. Custom component creation beyond MD3 specs
3. Backend changes for theme storage
4. Complete redesign of information architecture
