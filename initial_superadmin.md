# Super Admin System - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE
<!-- 
Provide a comprehensive description of what needs to be built.
Be specific about functionality, user interactions, and expected outcomes.
Include acceptance criteria if applicable.
-->

### User Story
As a super administrator, I want to have a dedicated login page and a simple dashboard showing basic platform statistics so that I can monitor the overall health of the FamilySync platform.

### Detailed Requirements
1. **Separate Authentication Flow**
   - Dedicated super admin login page at `/superadmin`
   - Separate authentication from regular family users
   - Super admin credentials stored securely in Firebase with special role
   - Simple email/password authentication

2. **Basic Statistics Dashboard**
   - Total number of registered users
   - Total number of active families
   - Total number of au pairs
   - Total number of host parents
   - Display statistics in simple cards following Material Design 3

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Super admin can log in through dedicated portal at `/superadmin`
- [ ] Dashboard displays basic statistics in read-only format
- [ ] System follows the same Material Design 3 patterns as main app
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] No access from regular user accounts

## EXAMPLES
<!-- 
Reference existing code patterns that should be followed.
Point to specific files in the examples/ directory.
Include both positive examples (to follow) and negative examples (to avoid).
-->

### Patterns to Follow
- Authentication flow: See `web-app/src/components/Auth/AuthWrapper.js`
- Dashboard layout: See `web-app/src/components/Dashboard.js`
- Card components: See `web-app/src/components/Shopping/ShoppingListCard.js`
- Modal patterns: See `web-app/src/components/Profile/LogoutConfirmModal.js`
- Firebase operations: See `web-app/src/hooks/useAuth.js`
- Table/list displays: See `web-app/src/components/FamilyManagement/FamilyMembersSection.js`

### Similar Features in Codebase
- User profile display: `web-app/src/components/Profile/ProfilePage.js`
- Data tables: `web-app/src/components/HouseholdTodos/SimpleTodoCard.js`
- Search functionality: `web-app/src/components/Shopping/SupermarketSelector.js`

### UI/UX Reference
- Use Material Design 3 components from existing design system
- Color scheme: Follow `/web-app/src/styles/DesignSystem.css`
- Icons: Use Material Icons as in existing components
- Layout: Card-based design with proper spacing

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
<!-- 
Capture all edge cases, gotchas, and special requirements.
This is critical for preventing common mistakes.
-->

### Known Gotchas
- Firestore limitation: Admin queries bypass security rules, must implement own validation
- React pattern: Keep admin routes completely separate from user routes
- Performance consideration: Paginate large user/family lists
- Security: Never expose super admin endpoints to regular users

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Super admin role verified on every request
- [ ] Separate Firestore collection for admin credentials
- [ ] Rate limiting on login attempts
- [ ] Session management with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Read-only access to statistics

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- Real-time statistics updates using Firestore listeners
- Efficient aggregation queries

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for login component
- [ ] Unit tests for statistics dashboard
- [ ] Integration tests for Firebase auth
- [ ] Security tests for role-based access

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all admin functions
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility for data tables
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Clear focus indicators

### Internationalization
- [ ] English interface (admin-only, no German needed)
- [ ] UTC timestamps with timezone display
- [ ] Number formatting for statistics
- [ ] Date formatting consistency

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for:
  - Authentication failures
  - Insufficient permissions
  - Network failures
  - Firebase connection issues

### Edge Cases
1. What happens if regular user tries to access admin routes?
2. What if Firebase connection fails?
3. How to handle invalid login attempts?

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed: None (use existing packages)
- Firebase services required: 
  - Authentication with custom claims
  - Firestore for reading user/family data
- Environment variables: 
  - `REACT_APP_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=mholzi@gmail.com`

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_SUPER_ADMIN`
- Data migration reversible: N/A (no data migration)
- Backward compatibility maintained: Yes (separate system)

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
<!-- 
Define how to verify the feature is working correctly.
Include both automated and manual validation steps.
-->

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Run these commands to validate implementation
cd web-app
npm run lint
npm test -- --coverage src/components/SuperAdmin
npm run build

cd ../functions
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- admin
```

### Manual Validation
- [ ] Super admin can log in at /superadmin
- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate statistics
- [ ] Statistics cards display correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] No access from regular user accounts
- [ ] Logout functionality works

### Integration Points
- [ ] Separate auth flow from regular users
- [ ] Statistics queries to Firestore
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading states for statistics
- [ ] Proper routing isolation

## NOTES
<!-- 
Any additional context, decisions made, or open questions.
-->

### Open Questions
None - all requirements clarified

### Assumptions
1. Only mholzi@gmail.com will have super admin access
2. Super admin system is completely separate from family user system
3. Basic statistics are sufficient for initial monitoring
4. Real-time updates via Firestore listeners for live statistics

### Out of Scope
1. User management features
2. Family management features
3. System monitoring beyond basic stats
4. Audit trails
5. MFA authentication
6. Any write operations
