# Super Admin System - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE
<!-- 
Provide a comprehensive description of what needs to be built.
Be specific about functionality, user interactions, and expected outcomes.
Include acceptance criteria if applicable.
-->

### User Story
As a super administrator, I want to have a dedicated login and monitoring dashboard so that I can oversee the entire FamilySync platform, monitor user activity, manage families, and ensure system health.

### Detailed Requirements
1. **Separate Authentication Flow**
   - Dedicated super admin login page at `/superadmin`
   - Separate authentication from regular family users
   - Super admin credentials stored securely in Firebase with special role
   - Session management with automatic timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required

2. **Super Admin Dashboard**
   - Overview statistics (total users, active families, system health)
   - Real-time monitoring of key metrics
   - Quick access to all management functions
   - System alerts and notifications

3. **User Management**
   - View all registered users (parents and au pairs)
   - Search and filter users by name, email, role, family
   - View detailed user profiles and activity logs
   - Ability to suspend/unsuspend user accounts
   - Reset user passwords
   - View user login history

4. **Family Management**
   - View all families in the system
   - See family composition and relationships
   - Monitor family activity levels
   - View family creation dates and subscription status
   - Access family data for support purposes (read-only)

5. **System Monitoring**
   - Firebase usage statistics (reads, writes, bandwidth)
   - Error logs and system alerts
   - Performance metrics
   - Active user sessions
   - Database size and growth trends

6. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all super admin actions
   - Timestamp and user attribution for every action
   - Export audit logs for compliance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Super admin can log in through dedicated portal
- [ ] Dashboard displays real-time system statistics
- [ ] All user and family data is accessible (read-only by default)
- [ ] Admin actions are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] System follows the same Material Design 3 patterns as main app
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go monitoring

-->

### Patterns to Follow
- Authentication flow: See `web-app/src/components/Auth/AuthWrapper.js`

### Similar Features in Codebase
- User profile display: `web-app/src/components/Profile/ProfilePage.js`
- Data tables: `web-app/src/components/HouseholdTodos/SimpleTodoCard.js`
- Search functionality: `web-app/src/components/Shopping/SupermarketSelector.js`

### UI/UX Reference
- Use Material Design 3 components from existing design system
- Color scheme: Follow `/web-app/src/styles/DesignSystem.css`
- Icons: Use Material Icons as in existing components
- Layout: Card-based design with proper spacing

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
<!-- 
Capture all edge cases, gotchas, and special requirements.
This is critical for preventing common mistakes.
-->

### Known Gotchas
- Firestore limitation: Admin queries bypass security rules, must implement own validation
- React pattern: Keep admin routes completely separate from user routes
- Performance consideration: Paginate large user/family lists
- Security: Never expose super admin endpoints to regular users

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Super admin role verified on every request
- [ ] Separate Firestore collection for admin credentials
- [ ] IP allowlisting for production environment
- [ ] Rate limiting on all admin endpoints
- [ ] MFA required for all super admin accounts
- [ ] Session tokens expire after 30 minutes
- [ ] All actions logged with timestamp and admin ID
- [ ] Read-only access by default, write actions require confirmation

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds for monitoring data
- Support pagination for > 100 users/families
- Efficient queries using Firestore indexes
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all admin components
- [ ] Integration tests for admin Firebase operations
- [ ] E2E test for complete admin login flow
- [ ] Security tests for role-based access
- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets
- [ ] Audit trail verification tests

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all admin functions
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility for data tables
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Clear focus indicators

### Internationalization
- [ ] English interface (admin-only, no German needed)
- [ ] UTC timestamps with timezone display
- [ ] Number formatting for statistics
- [ ] Date formatting consistency

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for:
  - Authentication failures
  - Insufficient permissions
  - Network failures
  - Firebase quota exceeded
  - Invalid operations
  - System errors

### Edge Cases
1. What happens if regular user tries to access admin routes?
2. What if Firebase Admin SDK fails to initialize?
3. How to handle concurrent admin sessions?
4. What if an admin account is compromised?
5. How to manage admin access revocation?
6. What happens during Firebase maintenance?

### Dependencies
- New npm packages needed: 
  - `firebase-admin` (for admin SDK)
  - `react-chartjs-2` (for monitoring charts)
  - `date-fns` (for date formatting)
- Firebase services required: 
  - Authentication with custom claims
  - Firestore for data access
  - Cloud Functions for admin operations
- Environment variables: 
  - `REACT_APP_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`
  - `REACT_APP_ADMIN_API_ENDPOINT`

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_SUPER_ADMIN`
- Data migration reversible: N/A (no data migration)
- Backward compatibility maintained: Yes (separate system)

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
<!-- 
Define how to verify the feature is working correctly.
Include both automated and manual validation steps.
-->

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Run these commands to validate implementation
cd web-app
npm run lint
npm test -- --coverage src/components/SuperAdmin
npm run build

cd ../functions
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- admin
```

### Manual Validation
- [ ] Super admin can log in at /superadmin
- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate real-time statistics
- [ ] User search and filtering works correctly
- [ ] Family data displays properly
- [ ] All admin actions are logged
- [ ] Session timeout works after 30 minutes
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] No access from regular user accounts

### Integration Points
- [ ] Separate auth flow from regular users
- [ ] Admin SDK integrated with Cloud Functions
- [ ] Real-time monitoring connected to Firestore
- [ ] Audit logs writing correctly
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading states for all data fetches
- [ ] Empty states for no data scenarios

## NOTES
<!-- 
Any additional context, decisions made, or open questions.
-->

### Open Questions
1. Should super admins be able to modify user data or only view?
2. What level of family data access is appropriate for support?
3. Should there be multiple admin permission levels?
4. How long should audit logs be retained?

### Assumptions
1. Only Markus (app owner) will initially have super admin access
2. Super admin system is completely separate from family user system
3. Read-only access is sufficient for most monitoring needs
4. Cloud Functions will handle sensitive admin operations

### Out of Scope
1. User data modification (initially read-only)
2. Billing/subscription management
3. Automated alerts/notifications
4. API access for external monitoring tools
5. Multiple admin roles/permissions
