# Shopping System Enhancement - PRP

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Enhance the existing shopping system to better align with family workflow requirements, focusing on parent-controlled scheduling, au pair execution, and seamless Todo/Task integration.

## 📋 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### ✅ What's Working
- Complete shopping list CRUD operations
- Receipt upload and approval workflow  
- Payment tracking and confirmation
- Family item database with photo storage
- Role-based access control
- Real-time synchronization
- Comprehensive error handling

### ❌ What Needs Enhancement
- **Missing scheduling integration**: Shopping lists scheduled for today should appear in Todo/Task section
- **Role clarity**: System currently allows both parents and au pairs to create lists, but requirements specify parent-only creation
- **Receipt workflow**: Need to ensure multiple receipt uploads automatically mark shopping as completed
- **Completion status**: Completed lists should remain visible with "completed" status rather than being archived

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Todo/Task Integration
**Goal**: Shopping lists scheduled for today appear as task cards in Todo/Task section

**Tasks**:
1. **Modify Dashboard Todo Logic**
   - Update `web-app/src/components/Dashboard/UpcomingEventsForMe.js` to include shopping tasks
   - Add shopping task card component integration
   - Ensure shopping tasks show for au pair when scheduled for today

2. **Create Shopping Task Card Component**
   - Extend existing `ShoppingListTaskCard.js` for Todo/Task section
   - Show supermarket, item count, and scheduling information
   - Direct navigation to shopping list page for completion

3. **Update Shopping Hook**
   - Modify `useShopping.js` to expose today's scheduled shopping lists
   - Add filtering logic for scheduled tasks

### Phase 2: Role-Based Creation Control
**Goal**: Only parents can create shopping lists, au pairs can only complete them

**Tasks**:
1. **Update Shopping List Page**
   - Hide "New List" button for au pairs
   - Show role-appropriate messaging
   - Update UI to reflect au pair as executor, not creator
   - Add separate "History" section for au pairs showing completed shopping lists

2. **Modify AddShoppingList Component**
   - Add role validation before allowing list creation
   - Ensure proper error handling for unauthorized access

3. **Update Backend Functions**
   - Add server-side validation for shopping list creation permissions
   - Ensure only parents can create/modify lists

### Phase 3: Receipt & Completion Enhancement
**Goal**: Multiple receipt uploads automatically mark shopping as completed

**Tasks**:
1. **Update Receipt Upload Flow**
   - Modify `ReceiptUpload.js` to support multiple receipt uploads
   - Auto-mark shopping as completed when first receipt is uploaded
   - Allow additional receipts to be added to completed shopping
   - Au pair can edit/delete receipts only before sending to parent for approval
   - Add "Send for Approval" button for au pair to submit receipts to parent
   - Receipt list locked once sent for approval (no additional receipts allowed)

2. **Enhance Payment Tracking**
   - Update `PaymentStatusCard.js` to show multiple receipts
   - Au pair enters total per receipt, system calculates running total
   - Display individual receipt amounts and cumulative total
   - Separate parent approval and payment confirmation steps
   - Maintain approval workflow for multiple receipts

3. **Completion Status Management**
   - Ensure completed lists remain visible with "completed" status
   - Remove archiving behavior for completed shopping lists
   - Update filtering logic to show both active and completed lists
   - Add separate "History" section for au pairs to track payment status of completed shopping

### Phase 4: Scheduling Enhancement
**Goal**: Parents can schedule shopping trips with specific dates/times

**Tasks**:
1. **Add Scheduling to List Creation**
   - Enhance `AddShoppingList.js` with date/time picker
   - Add scheduling fields to shopping list data structure
   - Validate scheduling permissions (parent-only)
   - Prevent scheduling for past dates/times with validation

2. **Update Shopping List Display**
   - Show scheduled date/time in shopping list cards
   - Add visual indicators for overdue shopping (red border, urgent styling)
   - Update sorting to prioritize scheduled items

3. **Integration with Calendar System**
   - Ensure shopping doesn't appear in calendar events
   - Maintain separation between calendar and shopping scheduling
   - Update Todo/Task logic to detect today's scheduled shopping

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Data Structure Updates
```javascript
// Shopping List Document Structure
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  createdBy: string, // Parent UID only
  assignedTo: string, // Au pair UID
  scheduledDate: Timestamp,
  scheduledTime: string, // "14:30"
  supermarket: {
    name: string,
    location: object,
    logo: string
  },
  items: object, // Item objects keyed by ID
  receipts: array, // Multiple receipt objects with individual amounts
  totalAmount: number, // System-calculated total across all receipts
  status: 'pending' | 'scheduled' | 'completed',
  receiptStatus: 'pending' | 'uploaded' | 'sent-for-approval' | 'approved',
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'payment-confirmed' | 'paid-out' | 'confirmed',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Component Updates
```javascript
// Todo/Task Integration
const getTodaysShoppingTasks = (shoppingLists, userUid) => {
  const today = new Date();
  return shoppingLists.filter(list => 
    list.assignedTo === userUid &&
    list.scheduledDate &&
    isSameDay(list.scheduledDate.toDate(), today) &&
    list.status !== 'completed'
  );
};

// Role-Based Creation
const canCreateShoppingList = (userRole) => {
  return userRole === 'parent';
};

// Multiple Receipt Support
const handleReceiptUpload = async (listId, receiptData) => {
  await uploadReceipt(listId, receiptData);
  await updateTotalAmount(listId); // Recalculate running total
  await markShoppingCompleted(listId); // Auto-complete on first receipt
};
```

### Security Rules Updates
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /families/{familyId}/shopping/{shoppingId} {
    // Only parents can create/modify shopping lists
    allow create, update: if request.auth != null && 
      resource.data.createdBy in resource.data.parentUids;
    
    // Au pairs can update completion status and upload receipts
    allow update: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid == resource.data.assignedTo &&
      onlyUpdatingFields(['items', 'receipts', 'status', 'receiptStatus']) &&
      // Can only edit receipts before sending to parent
      (resource.data.receiptStatus == 'pending' || resource.data.receiptStatus == 'uploaded');
    
    // Family members can read their family's shopping lists
    allow read: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid in resource.data.familyMembers;
  }
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX UPDATES

### Todo/Task Section
- **Shopping Task Cards**: Show supermarket logo, item count, scheduled time
- **Progress Indicators**: Display completion percentage for ongoing shopping
- **Overdue Indicators**: Visual changes for overdue shopping tasks (red border, urgent styling)
- **Direct Navigation**: Clicking task card navigates directly to shopping list page

### Shopping List Page
- **Role-Based UI**: Different interfaces for parents (creator) vs au pairs (executor)
- **Scheduling Interface**: Date/time picker for parents when creating lists (prevents past dates/times)
- **Multiple Receipt Display**: Gallery view for uploaded receipts
- **Shopping History**: Separate "History" section for au pairs showing completed shopping lists with payment status

### Receipt Upload Flow
- **Progressive Upload**: Allow multiple receipts to be added over time
- **Individual Amount Entry**: Au pair enters total per receipt
- **Running Total Display**: System calculates and shows cumulative total
- **Receipt Management**: Au pair can edit/delete receipts before sending to parent
- **Send for Approval**: Explicit button for au pair to submit receipts to parent
- **Receipt Lock**: Receipt list locked once sent for approval (no further changes)
- **Auto-Completion**: Visual feedback when shopping is marked complete
