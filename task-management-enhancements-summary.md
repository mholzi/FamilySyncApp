## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features

I've successfully implemented the three missing task management features that were identified in the cross-check:

- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states show edit hints (‚úèÔ∏è) for editable fields
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Role-based Access**: Only parents can edit, only on pending tasks

**User Experience:**
- Click any title or description text to edit it directly
- No need to open modal dialogs for quick text changes
- Immediate visual feedback with blue focus borders
- Auto-saves on blur or Enter key

### 2. üìã Bulk/Batch Operations

**What was implemented:**
- **Selection Mode**: "Select" button appears when there are 2+ pending tasks

**User Experience:**

- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 3. üì± Swipe Gestures for Mobile

**What was implemented:**
